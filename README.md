Hello there!

Excited to share my image generator project powered by ReactJS and NodeJS, integrated with the Hugging Face's Inference API for accessing Runwayâ€™s Stable Diffusion model.
ReactJS ensures a responsive and interactive user interface, allowing seamless user interactions and real-time updates.
NodeJS handles the backend operations, facilitating API requests and data processing. 
The Hugging Face's Inference API leverages advanced AI models to generate high-quality images based on user prompts, enabling creative content creation, mock-ups, and concept visualization with ease and precision.
Together, these technologies combine to offer a powerful tool for diverse image generation needs.

A look at the project-
